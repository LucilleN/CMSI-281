  * An implementation of an Arraylist of Forneymon (our class's parody of Pokemon) of varying types.
* Assignment 6: LinkedForneymonagerie.java 
  * An implementation of a LinkedList of Forneymon (our class's parody of Pokemon) of varying types.
* Assignment 7: Analysis of worst-case asymptotic (Big-O, O(g(n))) runtime complexity of selected methods from previous assignments, in the context of its class.
* Assignment 8: BinaryTreeNode.java and BinaryHeap.java
  * Implementations of a binary tree and a binary heap.
* Assignment 9: Dictreenary.java
